# Read:08 Summary
## SQL
* `SQL`:`( Structured Query Language)` : is a language designed to allow both technical and non-technical users query, manipulate, and transform data from a relational database. And
due to its simplicity, SQL databases provide safe and scalable storage for millions of websites and mobile applications.
* There are many popular SQL databases including `SQLite`, `MySQL`, `Postgres`, `Oracle` and `Microsoft SQL Server`. All of them support the common SQL language standard, which is what this site will be teaching, but
each implementation can differ in the additional features and storage types it supports.

***it's important to have a model for what a relational database actually is***
* A relational database represents a collection of related (two-dimensional) tables. Each of the tables are similar to an Excel spreadsheet, with a fixed number
of named columns (the attributes or properties of the table) and any number of rows of data.
* To retrieve data from a SQL database, we need to write `SELECT` statements, which are often colloquially refered to as queries.
* A query in itself is just a statement which declares what data we are looking for, where
to find it in the database, and optionally, how to transform it before it is returned.
