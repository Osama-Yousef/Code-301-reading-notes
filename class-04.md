## RegExr & CSS Grid & Regex
* RegExr was created by gskinner.com, and is proudly hosted by Media Temple.
* RegExr is an online tool to learn, build, & test Regular Expressions (RegEx / RegExp).
* Regular expressions (regex or regexp) are extremely useful in extracting information from any text by searching for one or more matches of a specific search pattern (i.e. a specific sequence of ASCII or unicode characters).
* Fields of application range from validation to parsing/replacing strings, passing through translating data to other formats and web scraping
* A regex usually comes within this form `/abc/`, where the search pattern is delimited by two slash characters` /` . At the end we can specify a flag with these values (we can also combine them each other)

> CSS Grid Layout is the most powerful layout system available in CSS. It is a 2-dimensional system, meaning it can handle both columns and rows, unlike flexbox which is largely a 1-dimensional system. You work with Grid Layout by applying CSS rules both to a parent element (which becomes the Grid Container) and to that […]ز

* Grid is the very first CSS module created specifically to solve the layout problems we’ve all been hacking our way around for as long as we’ve been making websites
***To get started you have to define a container element as a grid with` display: grid`***
* set the column and row sizes with `grid-template-columns `and `grid-template-rows`
* then place its child elements into the grid with `grid-column` and `grid-row`
* The element on which `display: grid` is applied. It’s the direct parent of all the grid items
* CSS grid lets us not only arrange elements in a row or a column, but in multiple rows and columns. Finally two dimensional layouts are becoming simpler!
