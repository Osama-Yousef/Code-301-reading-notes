## JavaScript and jQuery book by Jon Duckett pages 293-301, 306-331 and 354-357
* jQuery offers a simple way to achieve a variety of common JavaScript tasks quickly and consistently, across all major browsers and        without any fallback code needed. 
* jQuery doesn't do anything you cannot achieve with pure JavaScript. It is just a JavaScript file but estimates show it has been used on over a quarter of the sites on the web, because it makes coding simpler.
* jQuery even adds some extra CSS-style selectors which offer additional functionality
* jQuery simplifies each of these tasks, and allows you to write less code to achieve them. 
* jQuery's motto is "Write less, do more," because it allows you to achieve the same goals but in fewer lines of code than you would need to write with plain JavaScript. 
* With jQuery, when a selector returns multiple elements, you can update all of them using the one method. There is no need to use a loop.
* The ability to update all of the elements in the jQuery selection is known as implicit iteration
* The process of placing several methods in the same selector is referred to as chaining
* The `.htm 1 () ` and `.text () ` methods both retrieve and update the content of elements. This page will focus on how to retrieve element content.
* Here are four methods that update the content of all elements in a jQuery selection : `.htm 1 () ` and `.text () ` and `.replaceWith()`
  and `. remove() ` .
  
* Inserting new elements involves two steps: 
  * Create the new elements in a jQuery object 
  * Use a method to insert the content into the page 
  
* You can create attributes, or access and update their contents, using the following four methods :
  * `.attr()`
  * `. removeAttr() `
  * `. addCl ass() `
  * `.removeClass() `
  
* The` . css ()` method lets you retrieve and set the values of CSS properties
* jQuery allows you to recreate the functionality of a loop on a selection of elements, using the `.each ()` method.
* The `.on ()` method is used to handle all events. Behind the scenes, jQuery handles all of the cross-browser issues.
* The `.animate()` method allows you to create some of your own effects and animations by changing CSS properties. 

## 6 Reasons for Pair Programming
* pair programming : commonly involves two roles: the Driver and the Navigator. The Driver is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard. Handling the “mechanics” of coding, the Driver manages the text editor, switching files, version control, and—of course writing—code. 
* The reasons to use pair programming :
  * Greater efficiency
  * Engaged collaboration
  * Learning from fellow students
  * Social skills
  * Job interview readiness
  * Work environment readiness
